# Predicting-Solar-Energy

## Summary
This repo features an experiment I conducted using machine learning to model solar energy potential by region given meteorological data and location data. It explores the use of Recursive Feature Extraction with Cross Validation, Random Forest Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Multi-layer Perceptron.

### Abstract
With the effects of climate change continuing to worsen, solar energy represents one of the most viable energy alternatives to fossil fuel resources. Locating optimal sites for new solar farm construction remains imperative to the viability of the grid-decarbonization process. 

Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) remains a primary feature for predicting the solar output potential in a given region. DNI measures  the amount of solar radiation received by a surface that is held perpendicular (or normal) to the rays that come in a straight line from the sun. Unfortunately, DNI data can be challenging to obtain and computationally expensive to work with. Building on the work of Abiodun Olaoye and Pasion et al., this project implements machine learning (ML) techniques to construct models for predicting solar output. 

In particular, this paper demonstrates the effective use of Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation in optimizing the feature selection process. Working with data collected at 12 sites over 14 months, the best model overall, Random Forest Regressor,yielded an R-squared score of .668.
